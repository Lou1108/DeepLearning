# DeepLearning
A group project covering 2 assignments for the course Deep Learning in the Master program at Utrecht University

Assigment 2 - to do: (Deadline 18/06)
- try different models
- try and see if the other type of normalization are better for the models
- check the data downsampling (maybe there's some reference on the internet what is good or not)
- Check the memory optimization: if it's correct or if it's possible to improve it
- check if, for answering question d), we should consider an improvement for both datasets *or* for each individually

- Remember to answer questions and start writing the report
